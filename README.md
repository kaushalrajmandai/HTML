PART 1 — THINK & EXPLORE:
1. Why website looks different on mobile and laptop?
Because screen size and resolution are different.

2. What changes after adding viewport?
Page stops zooming out and text becomes readable.

3. Why text looks small without viewport?
Browser assumes desktop width.

4. How CSS detects screen size?
Using media queries.

5. What happens when breakpoint is crossed?
Layout, font size, or color changes.

6. Why layout is device dependent?
Different devices have different screen sizes.

7. Where is localStorage stored?
Inside browser storage.

8. Why data remains after refresh?
Because localStorage does not clear on refresh.

9. How website works without internet?
Logic runs inside browser.

10. How learning platforms remember progress?
By storing data locally or in database.

Part 4:Why does the animation feel smooth / aggressive / heavy?
	•	The animation feels smooth because the image grows slowly instead of appearing suddenly.
	•	Using scale makes the movement look natural, like the image is coming closer rather than jumping.
	•	The blur makes the background look distant, so the big image feels more important and focused.
	•	The same timing style is used for hover and click, so everything feels consistent.

Which keyframe had the biggest impact on motion?
	•	openImage is the most important keyframe.

What would break if that keyframe was removed?
	•	The image would pop up instantly in the center instead of animating.
	•	The transition from the card to the big image would look rough and unnatural.
